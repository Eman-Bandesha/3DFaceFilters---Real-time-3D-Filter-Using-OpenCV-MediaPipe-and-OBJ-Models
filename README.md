# 3DFaceFilters---Real-time-3D-Filter-Using-OpenCV-MediaPipe-and-OBJ-Models
3DFaceFilters is a Python project that applies a 3D mustache filter to a user's face in real-time using a webcam. It leverages OpenCV, MediaPipe, and custom OBJ models to create dynamic and realistic face filters that adapt to head movement and facial expressions.
