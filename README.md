# 3DFaceFilters - Real-time 3D  Filter Using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and OBJ Models

## Overview
3DFaceFilters is a Python project that applies a 3D  filter to a user's face in real-time using a webcam. It leverages OpenCV, MediaPipe, and custom OBJ models to create dynamic and realistic face filters that adapt to head movement and facial expressions.

## Features
- Real-time 3D filter rendering on the face using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- Accurate tracking of facial landmarks for precise filter placement.
- Dynamic scaling, rotation, and texture mapping of the 3D model to match face orientation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

You can install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```
